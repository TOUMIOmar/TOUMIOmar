# Hi there 👋 I'm Omar TOUMI

🔭 I’m currently working on an innovative e-commerce website using Next.js, Node.js, Express, Three.js, and MongoDB. 
This project will feature immersive UI elements like 3D product models and a 360-degree view of the boutique. 
It also includes an admin dashboard with statistics and full control over the website. You can check it out when it goes live at [misterbouton.com](https://www.misterbouton.com/).
